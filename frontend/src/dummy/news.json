    "description": " \nAlien-infested submarine sim Barotrauma has received a chunky update, bringing two new-ish monsters into its lethal aquatic world. The shrimp-looking Mantis may be recognisable to veterans (it once appeared in pre-Steam builds). And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a \"mini-rework\", which means drugs like morphine are \"less of a 'solution for everything'\". Wait. What?\n\n\nSubmariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/602960/view/4194615462166513946\" target=\"_blank\">Blood in the Water update</a>. Now the drugs have \"a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations.\" Well.

The shrimp-looking Mantis may be recognisable to veterans (it once appeared in pre-Steam builds). And the Viperling is a venomous variant of the existing Spineling (a thorny seaworm with hull-piercing porcupine-like spikes). But don't worry, the medical systems have also seen a \"mini-rework\", which means drugs like morphine are \"less of a 'solution for everything'\". Wait. What?\n</p>\n<p>\nSubmariners in the game can still use morphine, opium and fentanyl to ease the pain of a monster attack, broken bones, wrecked organs, or be-bulleted body. However, the developers feel these drugs have been over-used. So they've rebalanced the opiates as part of their <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/602960/view/4194615462166513946\">Blood in the Water update</a>. Now the drugs have \"a much higher risk of causing addiction and overdoses, and morphine heals much more slowly, making it less viable for combat-heavy situations.\" Well. Guess I'll just die. \n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/aqua-horror-sim-barotrauma-has-an-update-that-makes-opiates-less-of-a-solution-for-everything?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed\">Read more</a></p>",

They'll both take place side-by-side in the ExCel London this year, on 25th-27th October.\n</p>\n<p>\nEGX, of course, will feature a bunch of classic and upcoming games, while Comic Con is laser-targeted at our respected allies in the world of on-paper image-based storytelling with speech bubbles. EGX's headline partner is TikTok this year, which makes this a perfect nexus of entertainment artforms. All we need is a puppetshow now and possibly a semaphore stand, and the ritual will be complete.\n</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/egx-and-mcm-comic-con-are-sharing-a-london-venue-this-year?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed\">Read more</a></p>",

The trouble was, all my friends liked football and I have an abiding hatred of popular things, a hatred that has obviously served me well during my later career as an online news journalist. I played hockey instead, which is the superior sport in that you get a big nasty stick, but also relatively niche because you need more equipment.</p>\n<p>Still, I've enjoyed rediscovering football in videogames, and especially videogames that don't treat football with much respect.

Even though it&#039;s been almost a decade since its release, Fallout 4 has rocketed to the top of sales charts like a mushroom cloud into the atmosphere, which makes today&#039;s update perfectly timed: Fallout 4 is finally getting &lt;a&gt;a proper next-gen update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot; xml:lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;ICYMI: The Fallout 4 free next-gen update lands on consoles and PC April 25th! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lFnD4X5Q3o&quot;&gt;https://t.co/lFnD4X5Q3o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n📺 Performance and Quality Mode&lt;br /&gt;\n🛠️ Stability improvements and fixes&lt;br /&gt;\n💻 PC widescreen support&lt;br /&gt;\n🎮 Steam Deck Verified&lt;br /&gt;\n🎁 Free Creation Club Content &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JrJDqdn9tW&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JrJDqdn9tW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1781326921818677470?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 19, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The update brings major technical upgrades to console players. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S now get their own native versions of the game rather than relying on running applications made for older consoles. These new apps come with a Performance Mode, which targets 60 fps with 4k resolution and standard graphics settings, as well as a Quality Mode, which plays at 30 fps with a 4k resolution and graphics set to ultra. The notes also clarify that, when connected to a 120 Hz display, Quality Mode will target 40 fps, and when connected to a 1440p display, the game will run at 60 fps with a 1440p resolution regardless of rendering mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PC players aren&#039;t left out, either. In addition to launching on the Epic Store, the game will also support widescreen and ultra-widescreen for those who have them. Steam players will also be happy to hear that the game is now officially Steam Deck Verified, so you can take it on the go. That said, the update is not yet available on GOG, but will be sometime soon. &quot;We will let you know as soon as we can,&quot; the patch notes read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to a number of bug fixes across PC and console, the update provides all players with nine free Creation Club items. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bethesda.net/en/article/4RcipuAES2k0KP7eYf2DwD/fallout-4-next-gen-patch-notes&quot;&gt;You can read the patch notes in their entirety here&lt;/a&gt;.

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S now get their own native versions of the game rather than relying on running applications made for older consoles. These new apps come with a Performance Mode, which targets 60 fps with 4k resolution and standard graphics settings, as well as a Quality Mode, which plays at 30 fps with a 4k resolution and graphics set to ultra. The notes also clarify that, when connected to a 120 Hz display, Quality Mode will target 40 fps, and when connected to a 1440p display, the game will run at 60 fps with a 1440p resolution regardless of rendering mode.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PC players aren&#039;t left out, either. In addition to launching on the Epic Store, the game will also support widescreen and ultra-widescreen for those who have them. Steam players will also be happy to hear that the game is now officially Steam Deck Verified, so you can take it on the go. That said, the update is not yet available on GOG, but will be sometime soon. &quot;We will let you know as soon as we can,&quot; the patch notes read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to a number of bug fixes across PC and console, the update provides all players with nine free Creation Club items. &lt;a href=&quot;https://bethesda.net/en/article/4RcipuAES2k0KP7eYf2DwD/fallout-4-next-gen-patch-notes&quot;&gt;You can read the patch notes in their entirety here&lt;/a&gt;.

While a large volume of complaints have been about the lack of a performance mode, this update (like the last update) does not address that issue. However, it does aim to clean up a number of irritating errors involving the behavior of pawns, the player&#039;s AI companions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;An update for Dragon&#039;s Dogma 2 is now live on all platforms!&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nIt includes adjustments to the dragonsplague, Pawn behavior and fixes to various issues.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nSee details on the official website:&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/waEdG0ntSv&quot;&gt;https://t.co/waEdG0ntSv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nWe will keep you posted for future updates.&lt;/p&gt;\n— Dragon&#039;s Dogma (@DragonsDogma) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DragonsDogma/status/1783306639367663817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 25, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;For starters, this update makes it easier to detect dragonsplague, an affliction that, if untreated, can lead to devastating consequences for your pawns and your world. It&#039;s also contagious, so it&#039;s a good idea to nip it in the bud as soon as you first encounter it. When afflicted, pawns&#039; eyes will glow red – after this update, they&#039;ll glow more noticeably. The update also causes the disease to infect pawns less frequently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pawns should also be a lot less annoying now, thanks to a whole slate of minor refinements to their behavior. They&#039;ll jump off cliffs less often (which is hilarious&amp;nbsp;but a wild inconvenience), say some lines less often, say other lines at more appropriate times and become less likely to offer to be hired while passing by on the street. They&#039;re one of the highlights of the game, so anything done to make their constant presence more consistent is always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are also smaller adjustments, like adding the ability to zoom in on a character&#039;s face in shops, preventing monster attacks in town from leading to the player&#039;s arrest, and other miscellaneous bug fixes.

However, it aims to differentiate itself within the ever-growing genre with what Trialforge calls a single-player party-based system. Players will control a single vessel that channels various heroes known as the fallen. These are individual characters, each with unique skill sets, combat styles, and lore, that share the player-controlled vessel. As such, players can switch between different characters, but they&#039;ll need to do so with caution as they aren&#039;t all necessarily in alliance with each other.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the newest Deathbound trailer for yourself below&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCIz4JrZwzs&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;The relationships between characters also must be taken into effect as it greatly impacts gameplay,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;The Church of Death and Cult of Life are at odds with one another. Aligning opposing factions close to one another in the vessel will cause conflict, resulting in consequential combat effects. Alternatively, strong synergies with shared beliefs may offer combat buffs that can spell disaster for the ruthless boss awaiting steel and magic. No matter the creed, the fallen must fight as one.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trialforge says in combat, players will charge something called a sync meter that&#039;s shared across the fallen within the vessel. When the right opportunity shows itself, players can dispel the sync meter to unleash a devastating &quot;Morphstrike, with the combined power of the party.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n                  &lt;section class=&#039;type:slideshow&#039;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2023/08/04/8de8e1d5/deathbound_soulslike_indie_game_play2.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2023/08/04/eed75cdf/deathbound_soulslike_indie_game_play3.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2023/08/04/1fa59884/deathbound_soulslike_indie_game_play4.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2023/08/04/d668995f/deathbound_soulslike_indie_game_play5.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2023/08/04/8207e9fa/deathbound_soulslike_indie_game_play6.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2023/08/04/fb5a356d/deathbound_soulslike_indie_game_play_header.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2023/08/04/2ca6216f/deathbound_soulslike_indie_game_play1.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n          &amp;nbsp;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deathbound will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store sometime this year.

But once you&#039;ve adopted a canine companion, you probably hide them away in a house for safe-keeping, shielding them from the horrors of the game&#039;s hostile mobs. Today, Minecraft is adding a way to make them a little stronger – wolf armor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKF91_m_B2Q&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like leather armor, wolf armor can be colored using dyes in-game, so if you&#039;ve got multiple adopted animals, it&#039;ll still be easy to tell them apart. This variation is separate from the collar colors as well, creating plenty of possibilities. Even better, the game is also adding wolf fur variants for the first time, bringing eight new patterns for a total of nine. Each variant (Pale, Woods, Ashen, Black, chestnut, Rusty, Spotted, Striped, and Snowy) spawns in a specific biome. You can take a look at all the new breeds in the gallery below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n                  &lt;section class=&#039;type:slideshow&#039;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/c53305fb/snowy_wolfarticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/fdb5e87f/spotted_wolfarticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/339a4fd2/striped_wolfarticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/1c102aa0/woods_wolfarticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/9f20665f/ashen_wolf_with_puparticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/d0aee770/black_wolfarticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/98e9be24/chestnut_wolfarticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/3a3dc46a/pale_wolfarticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/23/1750129a/rusty_wolfarticle_image_1280x720.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n          &amp;nbsp;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, players will need to be able to craft this wolf armor as well, which is where the new mob, the armadillo, comes in. These armored relatives of anteaters can be found in savannah or badland biomes, where they can be seen strolling around and curling into a defensive ball when certain enemies come near. Armadillos drop armadillo scutes, which are used to make the wolf armor, but the developers have reassured players that they can be brushed rather than defeated, so you won&#039;t have to go on an armadillo massacre to protect your pets. Armadillos can also be used to scare away spiders since they eat insects and arachnids in real life, and spider eyes can be used to breed them if you want to make your own armadillo farm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-java-edition-1-20-5&quot;&gt;You can read the rest of the notes for the 1.20.5 update right here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dubbed &quot;The King&#039;s Trial,&quot; this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio&#039;s world more, highlighting a tournament for the king&#039;s throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmMz9QjUHmA&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That&#039;s not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus&#039; popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/games/persona_5/b/playstation4/archive/2017/03/29/persona-5-review-game-informer.aspx&quot;&gt;Persona 5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;ve played &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-5-royal/persona-5-royal-review-revealing-its-true-form&quot;&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/a&gt;, or even the recently released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-3-reload/into-the-light&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/a&gt;, then you know we&#039;re likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art.

The game&#039;s standard release will cost $69.99.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&#039;s what the Collector&#039;s Edition looks like&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            &lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/04/23/02729ac8/metaphor_refantazio_collectors_edition.jpg&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-style-body-default&quot; /&gt;\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Metaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more about the game, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2023/06/11/persona-makers-announce-metaphor-refantazio&quot;&gt;watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer.&lt;/a&gt; Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-5-royal/persona-5-royal-review-revealing-its-true-form&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer&#039;s &lt;/em&gt;Persona 5 Royal review&lt;/a&gt;, and then read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-5-tactica/one-more-uprising&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer&#039;s &lt;/em&gt;Persona 5 Tactica review&lt;/a&gt; after that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you picking up Metaphor: ReFantazio on day one?

It also reveals Metaphor: ReFantazio will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dubbed &quot;The King&#039;s Trial,&quot; this new trailer sets up a bit of the Metaphor: ReFantazio&#039;s world more, highlighting a tournament for the king&#039;s throne at the center of the narrative. It seems our protagonist and the friends and allies they encounter along the way are vying for a crown that others are also after. In order to claim it, players must complete trials across the lands, proving their worth. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check it out for yourself in the Metaphor: ReFantazio gameplay trailer below&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmMz9QjUHmA&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Metaphor: ReFantazio continues to look excellent, with its Persona inspirations on full display. That&#039;s not surprising, though, considering Studio Zero is composed of various leads from Atlus&#039; popular Persona series, including the latest in the franchise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/games/persona_5/b/playstation4/archive/2017/03/29/persona-5-review-game-informer.aspx&quot;&gt;Persona 5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;ve played &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-5-royal/persona-5-royal-review-revealing-its-true-form&quot;&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/a&gt;, or even the recently released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-3-reload/into-the-light&quot;&gt;Persona 3 Reload&lt;/a&gt;, then you know we&#039;re likely in for a treat when it comes to a few things: combat, narrative, and art.

The game&#039;s standard release will cost $69.99.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&#039;s what the Collector&#039;s Edition looks like&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            &lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/04/23/02729ac8/metaphor_refantazio_collectors_edition.jpg&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-style-body-default&quot; /&gt;\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Metaphor: ReFantazio hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC on October 11, 2024. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more about the game, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2023/06/11/persona-makers-announce-metaphor-refantazio&quot;&gt;watch the Metaphor: ReFantazio reveal trailer.&lt;/a&gt; Read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-5-royal/persona-5-royal-review-revealing-its-true-form&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer&#039;s &lt;/em&gt;Persona 5 Royal review&lt;/a&gt;, and then read &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/persona-5-tactica/one-more-uprising&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer&#039;s &lt;/em&gt;Persona 5 Tactica review&lt;/a&gt; after that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you picking up Metaphor: ReFantazio on day one?

As such, Embracer Group as we know it will be no more; instead, it will largely consist of Asmodee, Coffee Stain &amp;amp; Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each of these companies will be run individually and traded publicly in the market, with IP and franchises under the Embracer Group umbrella spread across them. This separation follows a rocky period for Embracer Group, which is behind layoffs at companies like&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/25/destroy-all-humans-remake-developer-black-forest-games-reportedly-lays-off-50&quot;&gt; Black Forest Games&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/29/embracer-group-cancels-new-deus-ex-game-in-development-at-eidos-montreal-lays-off&quot;&gt;Eidos-Montréal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xap47IbByoU&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;During the past years, the Group has made significant investments in acquisitions and into a strategy of accelerated organic growth. To further realize the untapped potential in Embracer Group and better optimize the use of its resources, Embracer Group announced a restructuring program in June 2023 divided into different phases lasting until March 2024,&quot; the company writes in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-announces-its-intention-to-transform-into-three-standalone-publicly-listed-entities-at-nasdaq-stockholm/&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Focus of the program has been cost savings, capital allocation, efficiency and consolidation, while also divesting selected studios.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following a careful and thorough review, it is the assessment of the Board of Directors that the current Group structure does not create optimal conditions for future value creation both for Embracer Group&#039;s shareholders and other stakeholders. To continue the transformation of Embracer Group into the future for the benefit of all employees, gamers and shareholders, the Board of Directors and the executive management have therefore decided to propose a separation of Embracer Group, creating three separate publicly listed entities: &#039;Asmodee,&#039; &#039;Coffee Stain &amp;amp; Friends,&#039; and &#039;Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends.&#039;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Embracer Group says each of these entities will have its own balance sheet, financial targets and structure, and allocation strategy. In short, each of these companies will be essentially independent of each other, even if they&#039;re formed from the same umbrella.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDehcsJNyl0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this new split, Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends is &quot;intended to remain a creative powerhouse in AAA game development and publishing for PC/console,&quot; a press release reads. It will remain the stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider IPs, with its main focus being the former.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will consist of studios like Crystal Dynamics, Dambuster Studios,&amp;nbsp;Eidos-Montréal, Flying Wild Hog Studios, Tripwire, Vertigo Games, Warhorse Studios, 4A Games, and more, with IPs including Dead Island, Killing Floor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, The Lord of the Rings, Metro, and Tomb Raider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Coffee Stain &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wkTsOoxqQc&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Embracer Group says this company &quot;is intended to consist of leading publishers and developers focused on a variety of games for PC, console, and mobile, including community-driven free-to-play games, LiveOps games, and indie/AA games.&quot; It will operate under two segments, according to the company: Premium and Free-To-Play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its &quot;Premium&quot; operations include studios like Coffee Stain, Ghost Ship, Tarsier, Tuxedo Labs, THQ Nordic, and Amplifier Game Invest. Its IPs include Deep Rock Galactic, Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Wreckfest, Teardown, Valheim, and more than 200 others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its &quot;Free-To-Play&quot; operations include studios like Easybrain, Deca, CrazyLabs, and Cryptic, with IPs in its wheelhouse including Soduku.com, Blockudoku, Jigsaw Puzzle, Star Trek Online, D&amp;amp;D Neverwinter Online, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Asmodee&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zGkdzec6-tY&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asmodee consists of 23 fully owned studios and more than 300 IPs and consists of the tabletop games section of Embracer Group. It will continue focusing on tabletop properties while collaborating in transmedia partnerships for IPs like The Lord of the Rings and others in the Embracer wheelhouse. &quot;As a global leader in board and trading card games, with a proven track-record of profitable growth, Asmodee is well-positioned to build on its strategy and continue to prosper as a standalone entity.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its IPs include Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders, Azul, Catan, Dobble, Exploding Kittens, and other board games based on The Lord of the Rings, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Netflix, Lego, and Star Wars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;This transformation is an important step in unlocking shareholder value,&quot; chair of the Embracer Group board Kicki Wallje-Lund writes in a press release. &quot;With this new structure, the three entities will be able to focus on executing their core strategies and leveraging their own strengths, providing more differentiated and distinct equity stories to both existing and new shareholders.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Embracer Group co-founder and CEO Lars Wingefors adds, &quot;This is the start of a new chapter, a chapter that I intend to remain part of as an active, committed, and supportive shareholder of all three new entities, with an evergreen horizon. This move toward three independent companies reinforces Embracer&#039;s vision of backing entrepreneurs and creators with a long-term mindset, allowing them to continue to deliver unforgettable experiences for gamers and fans across the globe.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends will remain within the current publicly listed Embracer Group, which itself will eventually be renamed. Asmodee and Coffee Stain &amp;amp; Friends will hit the market as separate companies within 12 months, during the 2025 calendar year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do you feel about this split in Embracer Group?

As such, Embracer Group as we know it will be no more; instead, it will largely consist of Asmodee, Coffee Stain &amp;amp; Friends, and Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each of these companies will be run individually and traded publicly in the market, with IP and franchises under the Embracer Group umbrella spread across them. This separation follows a rocky period for Embracer Group, which is behind layoffs at companies like&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/25/destroy-all-humans-remake-developer-black-forest-games-reportedly-lays-off-50&quot;&gt; Black Forest Games&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/29/embracer-group-cancels-new-deus-ex-game-in-development-at-eidos-montreal-lays-off&quot;&gt;Eidos-Montréal&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;after a planned $2 billion deal with Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group fell through in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xap47IbByoU&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;During the past years, the Group has made significant investments in acquisitions and into a strategy of accelerated organic growth. To further realize the untapped potential in Embracer Group and better optimize the use of its resources, Embracer Group announced a restructuring program in June 2023 divided into different phases lasting until March 2024,&quot; the company writes in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-announces-its-intention-to-transform-into-three-standalone-publicly-listed-entities-at-nasdaq-stockholm/&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. &quot;Focus of the program has been cost savings, capital allocation, efficiency and consolidation, while also divesting selected studios.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following a careful and thorough review, it is the assessment of the Board of Directors that the current Group structure does not create optimal conditions for future value creation both for Embracer Group&#039;s shareholders and other stakeholders. To continue the transformation of Embracer Group into the future for the benefit of all employees, gamers and shareholders, the Board of Directors and the executive management have therefore decided to propose a separation of Embracer Group, creating three separate publicly listed entities: &#039;Asmodee,&#039; &#039;Coffee Stain &amp;amp; Friends,&#039; and &#039;Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends.&#039;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Embracer Group says each of these entities will have its own balance sheet, financial targets and structure, and allocation strategy. In short, each of these companies will be essentially independent of each other, even if they&#039;re formed from the same umbrella.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDehcsJNyl0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After this new split, Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends is &quot;intended to remain a creative powerhouse in AAA game development and publishing for PC/console,&quot; a press release reads. It will remain the stewards of The Lord of the Rings and Tomb Raider IPs, with its main focus being the former.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It will consist of studios like Crystal Dynamics, Dambuster Studios,&amp;nbsp;Eidos-Montréal, Flying Wild Hog Studios, Tripwire, Vertigo Games, Warhorse Studios, 4A Games, and more, with IPs including Dead Island, Killing Floor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, The Lord of the Rings, Metro, and Tomb Raider.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Coffee Stain &amp;amp; Friends&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wkTsOoxqQc&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Embracer Group says this company &quot;is intended to consist of leading publishers and developers focused on a variety of games for PC, console, and mobile, including community-driven free-to-play games, LiveOps games, and indie/AA games.&quot; It will operate under two segments, according to the company: Premium and Free-To-Play.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its &quot;Premium&quot; operations include studios like Coffee Stain, Ghost Ship, Tarsier, Tuxedo Labs, THQ Nordic, and Amplifier Game Invest. Its IPs include Deep Rock Galactic, Goat Simulator, Satisfactory, Wreckfest, Teardown, Valheim, and more than 200 others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its &quot;Free-To-Play&quot; operations include studios like Easybrain, Deca, CrazyLabs, and Cryptic, with IPs in its wheelhouse including Soduku.com, Blockudoku, Jigsaw Puzzle, Star Trek Online, D&amp;amp;D Neverwinter Online, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Asmodee&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zGkdzec6-tY&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Asmodee consists of 23 fully owned studios and more than 300 IPs and consists of the tabletop games section of Embracer Group. It will continue focusing on tabletop properties while collaborating in transmedia partnerships for IPs like The Lord of the Rings and others in the Embracer wheelhouse. &quot;As a global leader in board and trading card games, with a proven track-record of profitable growth, Asmodee is well-positioned to build on its strategy and continue to prosper as a standalone entity.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its IPs include Ticket to Ride, 7 Wonders, Azul, Catan, Dobble, Exploding Kittens, and other board games based on The Lord of the Rings, Marvel, Game of Thrones, Netflix, Lego, and Star Wars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;This transformation is an important step in unlocking shareholder value,&quot; chair of the Embracer Group board Kicki Wallje-Lund writes in a press release. &quot;With this new structure, the three entities will be able to focus on executing their core strategies and leveraging their own strengths, providing more differentiated and distinct equity stories to both existing and new shareholders.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Embracer Group co-founder and CEO Lars Wingefors adds, &quot;This is the start of a new chapter, a chapter that I intend to remain part of as an active, committed, and supportive shareholder of all three new entities, with an evergreen horizon. This move toward three independent companies reinforces Embracer&#039;s vision of backing entrepreneurs and creators with a long-term mindset, allowing them to continue to deliver unforgettable experiences for gamers and fans across the globe.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Middle-earth Enterprises &amp;amp; Friends will remain within the current publicly listed Embracer Group, which itself will eventually be renamed. Asmodee and Coffee Stain &amp;amp; Friends will hit the market as separate companies within 12 months, during the 2025 calendar year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do you feel about this split in Embracer Group?

If you missed the event, we&#039;ve gathered each announcement here for a cursory glance at what showed up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Little Kitty, Big City - May 9&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWUdu2q88K4&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, you control a small cat in a mini-open world set within a bustling, Japanese-inspired metropolis. Your goal is to find a way home, but plenty of distractions and opportunities to help fellow animal friends or cause chaos will likely delay your departure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Yars Rising - Late 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPLapjFwSKo&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wayforward and Atari are teaming up for a 2D Metroidvania spin-off of the 1982 classic Yars’ Revenge. This side-scrolling platformer stars Emi Kimura, a young hacker (using the handle of Yar) who gets embroiled in an intergalactic conspiracy centered around a corrupt corporation. Yar can blast robots, climb platforms, sneak through vents, hide in doorways, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Refind Self: The Personality Test Game - Summer 2024&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QHoWSjUrhhM&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This 2023 choice-driven adventure stars an android whose creator has passed away. Unaware of its purpose, you’ll piece together your past by interacting with characters and making decisions to determine what the doctor had in mind for you. Decisions mold the android into one of 23 personality types. Are you a hero, researcher, artisan, or gambler? Whichever the case, Refind Self encourages multiple playthroughs, and you can share results and compare choices and personality results with other players.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Sticky Business - Today&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kveCJz9y3k&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First arriving last summer, this cozy shop simulator is now available on Switch. Players run a sticker shop where you’ll use over 400 elements and effects, such as sparkles and glitter, to fulfill specific customer requests. Giving customers their desired stickers causes them to open up to players and share their individual stories. The Plan with Me DLC adds new sticker elements and customer stories, and a bundle containing the DLC and the base game is also available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Antonblast - November 12&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nnjueEx8Gw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Dynamite Anton or Annie, smash through levels to reach Satan himself, who stole your prized spirit collection. Levels begin by setting bombs, then use your powerful hammer to smash enemies through destructible environments Reaching the end triggers a timer where you must race back to the start before the entire level detonates. A demo will be available later today, and Antonblast will launch as a timed console exclusive when it releases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Valley Peaks - 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iP2zieFUrwA&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a mountain-climbing frog, use your tongue to swing across mountain peaks to place radio towers and reestablish communications with fellow climbers. Each mountain presents its own platforming puzzle, challenging players to find the correct path. Along the way you’ll find equipment to ease climbing, play minigames, and take on side quests from other froggy climbers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Lorelei and the Laser Eyes - May 16&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SreQDMyQNHE&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Annapurna-published non-linear puzzle game finally hits next month. Created by the team behind Sayonara Wild Hearts, players control a woman invited to take part in a project set in an old European hotel. Her journey becomes a nightmarish and surreal adventure sporting over 100 puzzles with shifting mechanics and perspectives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Europa - 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTj1ndTPknY&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This vibrant sci-fi fantasy game could be mistaken for a Studio Ghibli joint. Players control an android boy with a jetpack-like device who explores a picturesque alien moon. Soar through levels to uncover the secrets of a lost civilization. A free demo is available later today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - July 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/75aZnLv0h3k&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originally an Apple Arcade exclusive, this roguelike adventure sees the Turtles traveling through reality-bending portals to find a kidnapped Master Splinter. Each turtle has their own abilities to take down the Foot Clan and other familiar foes, with every room granting new powers and upgrades.

If you missed the event, we&#039;ve gathered each announcement here for a cursory glance at what showed up.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Little Kitty, Big City - May 9&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LWUdu2q88K4&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the title suggests, you control a small cat in a mini-open world set within a bustling, Japanese-inspired metropolis. Your goal is to find a way home, but plenty of distractions and opportunities to help fellow animal friends or cause chaos will likely delay your departure.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Yars Rising - Late 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPLapjFwSKo&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wayforward and Atari are teaming up for a 2D Metroidvania spin-off of the 1982 classic Yars’ Revenge. This side-scrolling platformer stars Emi Kimura, a young hacker (using the handle of Yar) who gets embroiled in an intergalactic conspiracy centered around a corrupt corporation. Yar can blast robots, climb platforms, sneak through vents, hide in doorways, and more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Refind Self: The Personality Test Game - Summer 2024&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QHoWSjUrhhM&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This 2023 choice-driven adventure stars an android whose creator has passed away. Unaware of its purpose, you’ll piece together your past by interacting with characters and making decisions to determine what the doctor had in mind for you. Decisions mold the android into one of 23 personality types. Are you a hero, researcher, artisan, or gambler? Whichever the case, Refind Self encourages multiple playthroughs, and you can share results and compare choices and personality results with other players.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Sticky Business - Today&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kveCJz9y3k&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First arriving last summer, this cozy shop simulator is now available on Switch. Players run a sticker shop where you’ll use over 400 elements and effects, such as sparkles and glitter, to fulfill specific customer requests. Giving customers their desired stickers causes them to open up to players and share their individual stories. The Plan with Me DLC adds new sticker elements and customer stories, and a bundle containing the DLC and the base game is also available.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Antonblast - November 12&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6nnjueEx8Gw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As Dynamite Anton or Annie, smash through levels to reach Satan himself, who stole your prized spirit collection. Levels begin by setting bombs, then use your powerful hammer to smash enemies through destructible environments Reaching the end triggers a timer where you must race back to the start before the entire level detonates. A demo will be available later today, and Antonblast will launch as a timed console exclusive when it releases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Valley Peaks - 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iP2zieFUrwA&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a mountain-climbing frog, use your tongue to swing across mountain peaks to place radio towers and reestablish communications with fellow climbers. Each mountain presents its own platforming puzzle, challenging players to find the correct path. Along the way you’ll find equipment to ease climbing, play minigames, and take on side quests from other froggy climbers&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Lorelei and the Laser Eyes - May 16&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SreQDMyQNHE&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This Annapurna-published non-linear puzzle game finally hits next month. Created by the team behind Sayonara Wild Hearts, players control a woman invited to take part in a project set in an old European hotel. Her journey becomes a nightmarish and surreal adventure sporting over 100 puzzles with shifting mechanics and perspectives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Europa - 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTj1ndTPknY&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This vibrant sci-fi fantasy game could be mistaken for a Studio Ghibli joint. Players control an android boy with a jetpack-like device who explores a picturesque alien moon. Soar through levels to uncover the secrets of a lost civilization. A free demo is available later today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - July 2024&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/75aZnLv0h3k&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Originally an Apple Arcade exclusive, this roguelike adventure sees the Turtles traveling through reality-bending portals to find a kidnapped Master Splinter. Each turtle has their own abilities to take down the Foot Clan and other familiar foes, with every room granting new powers and upgrades. Spending earned currency at the sewer base unlocks permanent upgrades, and you can play alongside three other players in drop-in/drop-out co-op. TMNT: Splinter Fate is launching on Switch as a timed console exclusive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Cat Quest III - August 8&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5TQm1N8vuM&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sail the seven seas as an adorable feline pirate to engage in navel combat alone or with a friend in co-op.

Luckily, Nintendo plans to briefly step in to fill that void. Today, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1780219598505144668&quot;&gt;it announced the next Indie World Showcase&lt;/a&gt;, a live stream event focused on the latest indie titles to come to the Switch, for tomorrow, April 17.

The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;We have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6MCkDkolNb&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n— Star Wars (@starwars) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1779860978932265097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 15, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite&#039;s new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it&#039;s not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/05/02/anakin-padme-darth-maul-and-more-join-fortnite-in-new-star-wars-event&quot;&gt;Previous Star Wars crossovers&lt;/a&gt; included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/26/star-wars-ahsoka-tano-battle-pass-now-available-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-4&quot;&gt;Ahsoka joined the fray&lt;/a&gt; as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re interested in more Star Wars video games, you&#039;re in luck – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/magazine&quot;&gt;we just launched our latest cover story&lt;/a&gt;, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws.

The details have yet to be disclosed, but attentive fans of the science fiction juggernaut will notice something about the start date right away. The event is set to take place on Friday, May 3. The following day, May 4th, is known to many as Star Wars Day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;We have a good feeling about this...Star Wars is returning to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#Fortnite&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/6MCkDkolNb&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/6MCkDkolNb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n— Star Wars (@starwars) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1779860978932265097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 15, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most newsworthy piece of info here, however, is the fact that the teaser indicates collaborations across several of Fortnite&#039;s new modes. This includes the classic battle Royale mode, the survival/crafting Lego mode, and the rhythm Festival mode, though Rocket Racing was notably excluded. Crossovers between Fortnite and other IPs usually just include cosmetic bundles, but this seems to imply that it will provide content for three different areas of the game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The current Elements event pass technically includes a Lego variant skin as well as a guitar for Festival mode, so this Star Wars event could be as simple as that, but it&#039;s not unreasonable to speculate that Star Wars is a big enough property to warrant a larger scale crossover event. That said, this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; just speculation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/05/02/anakin-padme-darth-maul-and-more-join-fortnite-in-new-star-wars-event&quot;&gt;Previous Star Wars crossovers&lt;/a&gt; included a Darth Vader boss battle, lightsabers, blasters, and force abilities, as well as a huge roster of skins spanning the movies and shows. Most recently, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/26/star-wars-ahsoka-tano-battle-pass-now-available-in-fortnite-chapter-4-season-4&quot;&gt;Ahsoka joined the fray&lt;/a&gt; as a part of the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re interested in more Star Wars video games, you&#039;re in luck – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/magazine&quot;&gt;we just launched our latest cover story&lt;/a&gt;, which features an exclusive look at Star Wars Outlaws.

However, this isn’t an official revival but rather due to the work of a dedicated group of fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LawBreakers was created by Boss Key Productions, a team led by Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski. Upon launching for PlayStation 4 and PC in August 2017, it garnered a generally positive critical impression (read our review &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/games/lawbreakers/b/pc/archive/2017/08/11/a-passionless-prison-for-great-gameplay.aspx&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). However, it failed to find its place in the competitive multiplayer shooter market of the time, resulting in poor sales and low player engagement that eventually led to its early demise in September 2018.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, a team of passionate fans has worked to bring LawBreakers back. Dubbed The RELB Project, the project has been in the works since at least 2020. Its FAQ states that “This is a project to bring back the game LawBreakers, it&#039;s done by creating &#039;fake&#039; servers that the original game client uses. You can join by downloading the launcher, patching your game and playing like normal.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;RELB’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://relb.org/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; allows you to download the launcher. Despite this revival being an unofficial project, Cliff Bleszinki (who has been vocal about wanting to see LawBreakers come back) has given it his blessing and enthusiastically shared RELB’s Discord on Saturday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;Somehow LawBreakers is coming back, see below!!!&lt;br /&gt;\n---&lt;br /&gt;\nIf you&#039;re interested in this weekend&#039;s public test or future tests, join the RELB discord server to learn how to get set up and keep up with the current news! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/1COV57FZQ5&quot;&gt;https://t.co/1COV57FZQ5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n— Cliff Bleszinski (@therealcliffyb) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/therealcliffyb/status/1779235918433391086?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 13, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The RELB Project is still very much a work in progress, but the team held its first series of public playtests this past weekend. Although several modes and features from the game were disabled, these sessions appear to have been largely successful. The next playtest has not been scheduled, and the team is currently seeking more developers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What did you think of LawBreakers and are you excited to see it playable again?

She also has appears to have her own drone to soar across the cityscape. High-speed platforming is the name of the game, and maintaining a smooth flow state sends her into Defacer mode, transforming the world into a dreamy animated version of itself. Although the trailer doesn’t show off gameplay, it depicts Valah spraying paint to destroy B Corps’ robotic minions. You’ll also be able to create graffiti art using an array of paint and cosmetic tools.

However, EA has denied Grubb&#039;s reporting, telling&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-shoots-down-dead-space-2-remake-rumors-no-validity-to-this-story&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;We don&#039;t normally comment on rumors but there is no validity to this story.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Giant Bomb&#039;s&lt;/em&gt; Game Mess Mornings show, Grubb said, &quot;They were working on it, they were working on Dead Space 2 and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales, is how it was phrased to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He continues, adding, &quot;As it stands right now, they were working on it; it was in the concepting phase...pre-production, and now that work has been put on the shelf.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;[Game Mess Mornings]&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JeffGrubb&lt;/a&gt;, EA Motive was working on a &#039;Dead Space 2&#039; Remake which was in concept phase but got cancelled/shelved because of the lackluster sales of the first Remake.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThey are now working on Iron Man and Battlefield.&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/iqv0EGNXJX&quot;&gt;https://t.co/iqv0EGNXJX&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LziW0qx72X&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LziW0qx72X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n— Knoebel (@Knoebelbroet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1778082822873321978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 10, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grubb revealed this today following yesterday&#039;s news from Motive itself, where general manager Patrick Klaus announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/09/motive-studio-to-work-on-battlefield-as-iron-man-game-hits-major-internal-milestone&quot;&gt;the studio was creating a new team to support EA&#039;s Battlefield franchise&lt;/a&gt; while development on its Iron Man game with Marvel continues. Hours later, EA denied Grubb&#039;s claim in a statement to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following up on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s report, Grubb said on X (formerly Twitter), &quot;I give you my permission to believe EA if you want, but whenever a company says &#039;that isn&#039;t true&#039; but they don&#039;t specify which part of the story they are talking about, well...yeah. Dead Space 2 was definitely being planned. It had a code name. And they aren&#039;t making it now.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;news director Kat Bailey, who wrote&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s story about all this today, responded to Grubb, saying, &quot;My understanding based on my own sources is that the Dead Space 2 Remake was never considered. Also, EA&#039;s statement was pretty definitive.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;My understanding based on my own sources is that the Dead Space 2 Remake was never considered. Also, EA&#039;s statement was pretty definitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n— Kat Bailey🏳️‍🌈 (@The_Katbot) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/The_Katbot/status/1778130073100623924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 10, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&#039;s where it stands today. Grubb said Motive was working on a remake of Dead Space 2 before it was shelved following lackluster sales of last year&#039;s Dead Space remake, and EA says that&#039;s not true. Unfortunately, we&#039;ll likely never know the true story here, but if you were holding out hope for a remake of Dead Space 2, it&#039;s not happening for now it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For what&#039;s it&#039;s worth, we asked Dead Space remake creative director&amp;nbsp;Roman Campos-Oriola about the possibility of a Dead Space 2 remake in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2023/02/22/dead-spaces-new-and-original-creative-directors-reflect-on-the-remake&quot;&gt;interview conducted a few weeks after the game&#039;s launch&lt;/a&gt;. His response: &quot;...we&#039;ll see how the game performs, what the company wants, what the studio wants, what we as a team we want to do, and we&#039;ll figure it out from there. But for the moment, there&#039;s no specific plan defined.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more, read&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/dead-space-remake/to-remake-whole-again&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer&#039;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;review of Dead Space remake&lt;/a&gt;, and then read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/19/motive-studios-single-player-iron-man-game-being-developed-in-unreal-engine-5&quot;&gt;Motive&#039;s in-development Iron Man game&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Were you hoping for a remake of Dead Space 2 or are you glad Motive is working on Battlefield and Iron Man instead?

However, EA has denied Grubb&#039;s reporting, telling&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-shoots-down-dead-space-2-remake-rumors-no-validity-to-this-story&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;We don&#039;t normally comment on rumors but there is no validity to this story.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On &lt;em&gt;Giant Bomb&#039;s&lt;/em&gt; Game Mess Mornings show, Grubb said, &quot;They were working on it, they were working on Dead Space 2 and they are no longer working on it. It is on the shelf because the first game had lackluster sales, is how it was phrased to me.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He continues, adding, &quot;As it stands right now, they were working on it; it was in the concepting phase...pre-production, and now that work has been put on the shelf.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;[Game Mess Mornings]&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nAccording to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@JeffGrubb&lt;/a&gt;, EA Motive was working on a &#039;Dead Space 2&#039; Remake which was in concept phase but got cancelled/shelved because of the lackluster sales of the first Remake.&lt;br /&gt;\n&lt;br /&gt;\nThey are now working on Iron Man and Battlefield.&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/iqv0EGNXJX&quot;&gt;https://t.co/iqv0EGNXJX&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LziW0qx72X&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/LziW0qx72X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n— Knoebel (@Knoebelbroet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Knoebelbroet/status/1778082822873321978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 10, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Grubb revealed this today following yesterday&#039;s news from Motive itself, where general manager Patrick Klaus announced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/09/motive-studio-to-work-on-battlefield-as-iron-man-game-hits-major-internal-milestone&quot;&gt;the studio was creating a new team to support EA&#039;s Battlefield franchise&lt;/a&gt; while development on its Iron Man game with Marvel continues. Hours later, EA denied Grubb&#039;s claim in a statement to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Following up on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s report, Grubb said on X (formerly Twitter), &quot;I give you my permission to believe EA if you want, but whenever a company says &#039;that isn&#039;t true&#039; but they don&#039;t specify which part of the story they are talking about, well...yeah. Dead Space 2 was definitely being planned. It had a code name. And they aren&#039;t making it now.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;news director Kat Bailey, who wrote&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s story about all this today, responded to Grubb, saying, &quot;My understanding based on my own sources is that the Dead Space 2 Remake was never considered. Also, EA&#039;s statement was pretty definitive.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tw-align-center twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;My understanding based on my own sources is that the Dead Space 2 Remake was never considered. Also, EA&#039;s statement was pretty definitive.&lt;/p&gt;\n— Kat Bailey🏳️‍🌈 (@The_Katbot) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/The_Katbot/status/1778130073100623924?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 10, 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&#039;s where it stands today. Grubb said Motive was working on a remake of Dead Space 2 before it was shelved following lackluster sales of last year&#039;s Dead Space remake, and EA says that&#039;s not true. Unfortunately, we&#039;ll likely never know the true story here, but if you were holding out hope for a remake of Dead Space 2, it&#039;s not happening for now it seems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For what&#039;s it&#039;s worth, we asked Dead Space remake creative director&amp;nbsp;Roman Campos-Oriola about the possibility of a Dead Space 2 remake in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2023/02/22/dead-spaces-new-and-original-creative-directors-reflect-on-the-remake&quot;&gt;interview conducted a few weeks after the game&#039;s launch&lt;/a&gt;. His response: &quot;...we&#039;ll see how the game performs, what the company wants, what the studio wants, what we as a team we want to do, and we&#039;ll figure it out from there. But for the moment, there&#039;s no specific plan defined.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more, read&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/dead-space-remake/to-remake-whole-again&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer&#039;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;review of Dead Space remake&lt;/a&gt;, and then read about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/19/motive-studios-single-player-iron-man-game-being-developed-in-unreal-engine-5&quot;&gt;Motive&#039;s in-development Iron Man game&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Were you hoping for a remake of Dead Space 2 or are you glad Motive is working on Battlefield and Iron Man instead?

Revealed with a gameplay trailer during today&#039;s Triple-i Initiative Showcase, Kill Knight plunges players into an Eldritch abyss of horrors where waves of enemies stand in the way of their one goal: kill the last angel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once a loyal knight, betrayed, and banished to the Abyss,&quot; a press release for Kill Knight reads. &quot;A desecrated corpse inside reanimated armor. You rise to an eternal death. Branded Kill Knight, you have one purpose – kill the last angel. Players must learn to exploit enemy weaknesses, enact brutal executions, and weave through the Knight&#039;s Arsenal to tactically manage resources as they dance with death in the Abyss and take the fight to global leaderboards against friends and foes alike.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check out the Kill Knight reveal trailer for yourself below&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/po-37Dzig98&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Kill Knight, players are challenged to master the demon within as they descend through the voids of an eldritch arena and harness a devastating arsenal of armor and weapons against swarms of otherworldly horrors. As you can see in the trailer above, Kill Knight features fast and visceral top-down arcade-action combat with a disgustingly horrific otherworld to traverse through. There are five fatal layers to get through, each more deadly than the last, according to PlaySide Studios.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As you survive waves of enemies, your Kill Power will increase, which in turn increases your speed and damage. Plus, there are plenty of challenges to unlock your Knight&#039;s Arsenal &quot;and evolve your playstyle.&quot; In Master Mode, all five layers become one extended arena, and you can track your skill on a global leaderboard, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some Kill Knight screenshots for your viewing&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n                  &lt;section class=&#039;type:slideshow&#039;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/e3fe650d/screenshot_02.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/aaf08950/screenshot_03.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/f7140bea/screenshot_04.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/361f0358/screenshot_05.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/b4d72926/screenshot_01.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n          &amp;nbsp;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kill Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you going to check out Kill Knight later this year?

Plus, there are plenty of challenges to unlock your Knight&#039;s Arsenal &quot;and evolve your playstyle.&quot; In Master Mode, all five layers become one extended arena, and you can track your skill on a global leaderboard, too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some Kill Knight screenshots for your viewing&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n                  &lt;section class=&#039;type:slideshow&#039;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/e3fe650d/screenshot_02.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/aaf08950/screenshot_03.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/f7140bea/screenshot_04.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/361f0358/screenshot_05.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/10/b4d72926/screenshot_01.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n          &amp;nbsp;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kill Knights hits PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you going to check out Kill Knight later this year?

As pointed out on X (formerly Twitter) by &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1777876279607578793&quot;&gt;Genki_JPN&lt;/a&gt;, Utada&#039;s new Science Fiction album, which they released yesterday, features a re-recording of &quot;Hikari,&quot; the Japanese version of &quot;Simple and Clean.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re a Kingdom Hearts fan, you likely already know which song this is.

However, if you haven&#039;t touched the series in a while, or if you&#039;ve never played the beginning of Kingdom Hearts, it&#039;s the Japanese version of the song in this famous game opener below:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nKizH5TV_g&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the new recording of &quot;Hikari,&quot; its place on Science Fiction makes sense because its Utada&#039;s first greatest hits album, if you will, meant to act as a compilation with new mixes of old songs, re-recordings of fan-favorite tracks, and more. You can listen to the album, which features 26 tracks, starting today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re interested in hearing the new recording of &quot;Hikari,&quot; you can listen below:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6_WhIHwiYOw&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more about Kingdom Hearts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/10/kingdom-hearts-4-revealed-in-20th-anniversary-trailer&quot;&gt;watch the Kingdom Hearts IV trailer here&lt;/a&gt;, and then check out&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/kingdom-hearts-iii/a-main-attraction-worth-waiting-for&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer&#039;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Kingdom Hearts III review&lt;/a&gt;.

Led by former Bungie leader Chris Opdahl, who has more than 20 years of experience as a game developer working on franchises like Halo and Destiny, Hidden Grove is the new team within ProbablyMonsters working on this multiplayer project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;At Hidden Grove, it&#039;s not just about developing something different in the field of competitive multiplayer games – it&#039;s about doing it better as a team,&quot; Opdahl writes in a press release. &quot;We believe that great games start with great teams, and we&#039;re building a creative atmosphere where artists, engineers, and creators can come together and thrive.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            &lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/04/09/80cd9e2d/hidden_grove_logo.jpg&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-style-body-default&quot; /&gt;\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;ProbablyMonsters says Opdahl founded Hidden Grove with two design directors – Raylene Deck and Grant Mackay – both of whom worked together on Destiny. &quot;They&#039;re supported by a full leadership team of world-building, engineering, and production veterans, including executive producer Lori Ada Kilty, art director Jedd Chevrier, senior engineering director Dean Johnson, and narrative director Kate Welch,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Together, they bring significant AAA experience spread across Halo, Destiny, Mass Effect, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, and more.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hidden Grove says it is hiring, and seeking diverse, motivated, highly skilled people &quot;who share their passion for bringing something new into the world.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            &lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/04/09/f193a707/hidden_grove_team_photo.jpg&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-style-body-default&quot; /&gt;\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHidden Grove\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for what to expect of Hidden Grove&#039;s first game, all ProbablyMonsters has shared is that it&#039;s a competitive multiplayer &quot;adventure game&quot; using Unreal Engine 5. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, ProbablyMonsters has a new chief product officer in Adam Rymer. He will report directly to ProbablyMonsters founder and CEO Harold Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our definition of product isn&#039;t just the games here at ProbablyMonsters; it&#039;s also the design of the teams themselves,&quot; Rymer writes in a press release. &quot;Beyond Hidden Grove, we have unannounced development projects that I&#039;m excited for us to share in the future.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What kind of game do you hope Hidden Grove creates?

Led by former Bungie leader Chris Opdahl, who has more than 20 years of experience as a game developer working on franchises like Halo and Destiny, Hidden Grove is the new team within ProbablyMonsters working on this multiplayer project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;At Hidden Grove, it&#039;s not just about developing something different in the field of competitive multiplayer games – it&#039;s about doing it better as a team,&quot; Opdahl writes in a press release. &quot;We believe that great games start with great teams, and we&#039;re building a creative atmosphere where artists, engineers, and creators can come together and thrive.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            &lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/04/09/80cd9e2d/hidden_grove_logo.jpg&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-style-body-default&quot; /&gt;\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;ProbablyMonsters says Opdahl founded Hidden Grove with two design directors – Raylene Deck and Grant Mackay – both of whom worked together on Destiny. &quot;They&#039;re supported by a full leadership team of world-building, engineering, and production veterans, including executive producer Lori Ada Kilty, art director Jedd Chevrier, senior engineering director Dean Johnson, and narrative director Kate Welch,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Together, they bring significant AAA experience spread across Halo, Destiny, Mass Effect, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, and more.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hidden Grove says it is hiring, and seeking diverse, motivated, highly skilled people &quot;who share their passion for bringing something new into the world.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\n  \n      \n            &lt;img loading=&quot;lazy&quot; src=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/04/09/f193a707/hidden_grove_team_photo.jpg&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;image-style-body-default&quot; /&gt;\n      \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHidden Grove\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for what to expect of Hidden Grove&#039;s first game, all ProbablyMonsters has shared is that it&#039;s a competitive multiplayer &quot;adventure game&quot; using Unreal Engine 5. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, ProbablyMonsters has a new chief product officer in Adam Rymer. He will report directly to ProbablyMonsters founder and CEO Harold Ryan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Our definition of product isn&#039;t just the games here at ProbablyMonsters; it&#039;s also the design of the teams themselves,&quot; Rymer writes in a press release. &quot;Beyond Hidden Grove, we have unannounced development projects that I&#039;m excited for us to share in the future.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What kind of game do you hope Hidden Grove creates?

The game received a lot of hype when it was first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2023/06/11/ubisofts-open-world-star-wars-game-is-out-next-year&quot;&gt;revealed during last summer&#039;s Xbox Games Showcase&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/ubisoft-forward/2023/06/12/check-out-the-gameplay-debut-of-ubisofts-star-wars-outlaws&quot;&gt;subsequent gameplay footage&lt;/a&gt; during a Ubisoft Forward stream the next day. Today&#039;s story trailer not only gave us more to whet our appetite but also let us know when we&#039;ll finally be able to step into the role of Kay Vess as we navigate the Star Wars underworld.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Star Wars Outlaws puts you in the role of Kay Vess, a pickpocket turned thief who gets mixed up with Sliro, the leader of Zerek Besh, a new criminal syndicate. Sliro places a bounty on Kay&#039;s head, and Kay and Nix have one shot at freedom: pulling off the ultimate heist. Together, Kay and Nix must navigate the criminal underworld, managing their reputations with various criminal organizations, including the Pyke Syndicate, the Hutt Cartel, the Ashiga Clan (a new syndicate created for this game in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games), and Crimson Dawn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kay and Nix&#039;s adventure will take them to various planets and moons, including Tatooine, Akiva, Kijimi, Canto Bight, and the newly created moon, Toshara. These planets and moons house busy cities and cantinas, sprawling open-world areas to explore, and orbital areas Kay and Nix can explore using her ship, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trailblazer&lt;/em&gt;. While in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Trailblazer&lt;/em&gt;, Kay can engage in chases, evasive maneuvers, and dogfights with the Empire or other enemies she makes along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;In search of true freedom, the resourceful Kay and Nix will journey through the underworld across the Outer Rim, taking on jobs from syndicates, facing off against intimidating foes, avoiding oppressive Imperial rule, and recruiting a skilled outlaw crew in order to pull off one of the greatest heists the galaxy has ever seen,&quot; creative director Julian Gerighty said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can see the story trailer below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcdKEy-aJ6o&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Star Wars Outlaws invites fans to experience a side of the galaxy that has a treasure trove yet to be explored, the exploits of the scoundrels taking advantage of the golden age of the underworld,&quot; vice president of Lucasfilm Games Douglas Reilly said in that same press release. We&#039;ve been inspired by Massive Entertainment&#039;s dedication to bringing this aspect of Star Wars to life, including both iconic and new things for fans to explore in an open world.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The upcoming title features three different versions. The Standard Edition includes the base game for $70. Meanwhile, the Gold Edition adds the Season Pass, which consists of two pieces of DLC, the exclusive &quot;Jabba&#039;s Gambit&quot; mission at launch, the &quot;Kessel Runner Character Pack&quot; cosmetic pack, and up to three days of early access. The Ultimate Edition includes all that, plus the Sabacc Shark Bundle (cosmetics for Kay, her blaster, Nix, Kay&#039;s speeder, and Kay&#039;s ship), the Rogue Infiltrator Bundle (cosmetics for the same items as the Sabacc Shark Bundle), and a digital art book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Star Wars Outlaws arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on August 30. If you&#039;d like to learn more, we&#039;ve got you covered! We recently traveled to Malmö, Sweden, to spend several hours with the developers and get our hands on the game.

Motive will help develop future Battlefield experiences as it continues to work on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/19/motive-studios-single-player-iron-man-game-being-developed-in-unreal-engine-5&quot;&gt;Iron Man game with Marvel&lt;/a&gt;, which it says has hit a &quot;major internal milestone.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This news comes from a new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/motive/news/motive-joins-battlefield-update-from-patrick-klaus-gm&quot;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Motive&#039;s general manager, Patrick Klaus, where he also reveals the directors behind the studio&#039;s Dead Space remake – executive producer Philippe Ducharme and creative director Roman Campos-Oriola – will build a new team to work alongside EA&#039;s Battlefield studios.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cDxw4098Qzo&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Their proven expertise in storytelling, immersive battles, and developing on the Frostbite engine uniquely positions them to help advance the vision for Battlefield, led by Vince Zampella (EVP, group general manager for Respawn and Battlefield) and Byron Beede (SVP, general manager for Battlefield).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;In parallel, development continues to move forward on our Iron Man project, led by Olivier Proulx (executive producer) and Ian Frazier (creative director). The team made excellent progress this year, hitting a major internal milestone and laying a robust foundation for the journey ahead. Iron Man is an important priority for Motive, and I&#039;m very proud of the work we&#039;ve accomplished so far.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motive will work with other EA studios like Criterion, DICE, and Ripple Effect to further expand the company&#039;s Battlefield franchise, which saw its last entry, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/review/battlefield-2042/battlefield-2042-review-the-battle-of-the-bugs&quot;&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/a&gt;, released in 2021.

The team behind Witchfire, The Astronauts, says today&#039;s update is the &quot;first major&quot; patch for the game, which is why it contains so much additional content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alongside new classes, enemies, weapons, and spells, the Ghost Galleon update also includes new events to take part in, a shop vendor offering novel items, and more features for players to explore. This update, like the game itself, is available right now on PC on the Epic Games Store.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To go with today&#039;s news, The Astronauts have released a new Witchfire trailer showcasing what you can expect:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot;  allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8fo6oF-YWU0&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Alongside the new features available in today&#039;s patch, The Astronauts team has implemented careful redesigns of Witchfire&#039;s level progression and Calamity systems, based on Early Access feedback,&quot; a press release reads. &quot;Players will begin the game with souls-style classes, granting boosts to certain stats and unique gear. Classes include Slayer, Berserker, Hunter, Shadow, Saint, and Pentinent – the final class is for Witchfire veterans seeking an extra challenge.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Astronauts says a new feature called Gnosis will allow players to slightly over-level without a corresponding uptick in enemy difficulty. The team says Gnosis represents the players&#039; knowledge of dark magic and that as this occult knowledge expands, &quot;players gain power and uncover hidden paths and events in the game.&quot; The Ghost Galleon update also adds the Calamity Meter to the HUD, which shows players the steps they take to make Calamities more likely.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are some screenshots from the Ghost Galleon update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n                  &lt;section class=&#039;type:slideshow&#039;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/09/15e2f79e/witchfire_ghost_galleon_update_03.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/09/f547b0cc/witchfire_ghost_galleon_update_02.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/09/ff77cb32/witchfire_ghost_galleon_update_04.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/09/b2f209b2/witchfire_ghost_galleon_update_05.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/09/6f4fc651/witchfire_ghost_galleon_update_06.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/09/d1e86b71/witchfire_ghost_galleon_update_07.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/09/95b2e85b/witchfire_ghost_galleon_update_08.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#039;https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/entity_browser_thumbnail/public/2024/04/09/926c7da5/witchfire_ghost_galleon_update_01.jpg&#039;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;\n          &amp;nbsp;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&#039;s a rundown of everything available in today&#039;s Ghost Galleon update&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;3 new Calamities (including the Ghost Galleon)&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;New activity: Vault Raiding&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;6 new classes&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;5 new weapons&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;4 new spells (plus 4 redesigned spells)&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;New shop vendor&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;7 new magical items (fetishes, rings, relics)&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;10 new or variant enemies&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;5 new events&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;6 new traps&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Calamity redesign&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Gnostic knowledge and level progression&lt;/li&gt;\n\t&lt;li&gt;Quality of Life updates and bug fixes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a more detailed breakdown of everything new, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theastronauts.com/&quot;&gt;check out the Ghost Galleon patch notes here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Witchfire entered Early Access back in September.
